# Datathon
This repository contains all the files for the Datathon project. It includes a README file providing an overview of the project, the source code used for analysis, the datasets utilized, and the final presentation summarizing our findings. Group members contributing to this project include Hemen Asfaw, Michael David, Josh LaFronz, and Jake Soldera.

Who are your stakeholders?
- The owners of small, women-owned, and minority-owned businesses who want to maximize the amount they receieve from EPA contract awards.

What problem are you trying to solve for the stakeholders?
- While many businesses receive the maximum amount of money for an EPA contract, there are many that do not. How can the stakeholders ensure that they do not leave any money on the table?
  
How will you solve the problem?
- We will search for variables that affect the probability of a small, women-owned, minority-owned business obtaining the maximum amount of money for an EPA contract.
